EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This submission presents a comprehensive medical patient management system developed as a full-stack web application. The system has been designed and implemented to meet all specified assessment criteria whilst incorporating advanced features that exceed baseline requirements. The application demonstrates proficiency in server-side programming, database design, web security, and modern frontend technologies with a focus on chronological data presentation for enhanced clinical workflow.

LEARNING OUTCOMES ADDRESSED

LO1 - Dynamic Website Construction and Web Security:
The application demonstrates thorough understanding of full-stack development concepts through implementation of secure authentication systems, data validation mechanisms, and protection against common web vulnerabilities including SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.

LO2 - Secure Full-Stack Website Construction:
The system has been constructed using industry-standard tools and technologies, incorporating proper separation of concerns, secure coding practices, and scalable architecture patterns suitable for healthcare data management with optimised data presentation.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

1. CORE FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS

1.1 Database Operations (CRUD)
The system implements comprehensive Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations across all major entities:
• Patient Management: Registration, profile updates, record retrieval, and account deactivation
• Medication Records: Prescription logging, dosage tracking, treatment history, and record modification
• User Administration: Account creation, role assignment, authentication, and access control

1.2 Advanced Search Implementation
Multi-criteria search functionality has been implemented to exceed basic requirements:
• Patient Search: Full-text search across name, surname, and patient identification numbers
• Medication Search: Filtered queries by patient association, medication type, prescription dates, and clinical remarks
• Real-time Results: Asynchronous search implementation providing immediate feedback without page reloading
• Chronological Ordering: All search results presented in ascending chronological order for optimal clinical workflow

1.3 Security Framework
Comprehensive security measures have been implemented to protect against identified threats:
• SQL Injection Prevention: All database interactions utilise prepared statements with parameter binding
• Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Mitigation: Input sanitisation and output encoding implemented throughout
• Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection: Token-based verification for all state-changing operations
• Authentication & Authorisation: Role-based access control with secure password hashing (bcrypt)
• Session Security: Proper session management with regeneration and secure cleanup procedures

2. ADVANCED TECHNICAL FEATURES

2.1 Data Presentation Optimisation
The system implements chronological data ordering for enhanced clinical workflow:
• Patient Records: Ordered by registration sequence (Patient_ID ASC) showing earliest registrations first
• Medication History: Ordered by prescription date (System_Date ASC) enabling chronological treatment review
• Combined Records: Unified view maintaining chronological medication sequence for comprehensive patient history
• User Interface: Clear headers indicating chronological ordering with descriptive subtitles

2.2 Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) Implementation
Modern fetch API has been extensively utilised to provide enhanced user experience:
• Form Submission: Asynchronous processing with real-time validation feedback
• Dynamic Content Loading: On-demand data retrieval without full page refreshes
• Cascading Dropdowns: Geographic data filtering (towns based on country selection)
• Search Autocomplete: Predictive text functionality for improved usability

2.2 Template Engine Integration
Twig template engine has been integrated to achieve professional separation of concerns:
• Logic Separation: Clear distinction between presentation layer and business logic
• Code Reusability: Modular template components for consistent user interface
• Maintainability: Centralised template management for efficient development workflow
• Security Enhancement: Automatic output escaping to prevent XSS vulnerabilities

3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

3.1 Backend Infrastructure
• Programming Language: PHP 8+ with object-orientated programming principles
• Database System: MySQL with normalised relational schema design featuring optimised chronological queries
• Dependency Management: Composer with PSR-4 autoloading standards
• API Design: RESTful endpoints for frontend-backend communication with consistent data ordering
• Error Handling: Comprehensive exception management and logging

3.2 Frontend Implementation
• JavaScript: Modern ES6+ features with modular code organisation and chronological data handling
• Styling Framework: Tailwind CSS for responsive and accessible design
• User Experience: Progressive enhancement with graceful degradation and intuitive chronological navigation
• Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 compliance with semantic HTML and ARIA labels

3.3 Database Design
• Normalisation: Third Normal Form (3NF) compliance for data integrity
• Relationships: Foreign key constraints ensuring referential integrity
• Performance: Indexed primary keys and optimised query structures with chronological ordering
• Data Validation: Constraint-based validation at database level

4. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND TESTING

4.1 Security Testing
• Penetration testing conducted for common vulnerabilities
• Input validation verified across all user entry points
• Authentication mechanisms tested for bypass attempts
• Session management evaluated for security weaknesses

4.2 Functionality Testing
• CRUD operations verified across all data entities
• Search functionality tested with various query combinations
• User interface tested across multiple browsers and devices
• Error handling validated for edge cases and invalid inputs
• Chronological ordering verified across all data presentation areas

4.3 User Experience Testing
• Chronological data flow tested for clinical workflow optimisation
• Interface responsiveness verified across different screen sizes
• Dark mode functionality tested for accessibility compliance
• Cache-busting mechanisms validated for consistent updates

PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT REFLECTION

This project has provided valuable experience in:
• Full-stack web development using industry-standard technologies
• Database design and optimisation for healthcare applications with chronological data presentation
• Web security implementation and vulnerability assessment
• Project management and version control using Git with comprehensive commit history
• Professional code documentation and maintenance practices
• User experience design with focus on clinical workflow optimisation

The completed system demonstrates readiness for production deployment in healthcare environments whilst maintaining strict security and data protection standards. The implementation of chronological data ordering enhances clinical workflow efficiency and provides healthcare professionals with intuitive access to patient history and treatment progression.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
